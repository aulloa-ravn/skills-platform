Implementation:

- Sprints should be iterative, improving the product with each iteration.
- Each sprint must deliver a functional improvement on both the frontend (/apps/web) and backend (/apps/api).

Limitations:

- Integration with Mission Board is not yet possible. Leave it for last. Meanwhile, let's populate the DB with fake data.

To know:

- This is a starter monorepo project.
- Create migrations for the database schema defined in PRD file.
- All emails must be from the `ravn.com` domain.
- Seed the DB with the top 50 tech skills. For example:
  - Skill: React / Default Discipline: Frontend
  - Skill: Node.js / Default Discipline: Backend
  - Skill: JavaScript / Default Discipline: Languages
  - Skill: TypeScript / Default Discipline: Languages
  - etc.
- Skip testing for now.
