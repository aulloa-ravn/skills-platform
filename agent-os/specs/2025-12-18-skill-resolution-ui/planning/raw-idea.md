# Raw Idea: Skill Resolution UI

Roadmap item 12: Skill Resolution UI — Add action buttons and proficiency adjustment controls to review cards with optimistic updates and success feedback

This is a UI feature that will add interactive controls to the existing Validation Inbox review cards, allowing tech leads and admins to approve, adjust proficiency levels, or reject skill suggestions. It needs to integrate with the Skill Resolution API (item 11 which was just completed) and provide a smooth user experience with optimistic updates.
