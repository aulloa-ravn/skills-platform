# Skills Taxonomy Seeding - Raw Idea

## Feature Description

Seed the database with top 50 tech skills including discipline mappings (e.g., React/Frontend, Node.js/Backend, TypeScript/Languages).

## Context

This is roadmap item #2 from the product roadmap. It is a foundational feature that enables development without Mission Board integration by providing a canonical set of skills that can be used throughout the system.

## Key Requirements from Roadmap

- Seed database with **top 50 tech skills**
- Include **discipline mappings** for each skill
- Examples provided:
  - React → Frontend
  - Node.js → Backend
  - JavaScript/TypeScript → Languages

## Purpose

Enable the platform to function with a predefined set of technology skills that employees can report on and tech leads can validate. This provides the foundation for the skill validation workflow and profile management features.

## Success Criteria

- All 50 skills are seeded into the database
- Each skill has an associated discipline
- Skills follow the schema defined in the Prisma models
- Data can be queried and used by subsequent features
