## Feature Description

Roadmap item 13: Admin Skills Management API — Build CRUD endpoints for managing the canonical skills taxonomy (add, edit, disable skills)

This is a backend API feature that will allow admins to manage the master list of skills in the system. It needs to provide GraphQL mutations for creating new skills, editing existing skills, and disabling/archiving skills (soft delete).
