# Raw Idea

Roadmap item 11: Skill Resolution API — Implement mutation for batch processing validation decisions (Approve, Adjust Level, Reject) with proper database updates

This is a GraphQL mutation API that will allow tech leads and admins to process pending skill suggestions by approving them, adjusting their proficiency level, or rejecting them. This needs to handle batch operations and update the database accordingly.
