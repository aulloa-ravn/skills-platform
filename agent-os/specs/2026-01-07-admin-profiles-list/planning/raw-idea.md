# Admin Profiles List - Raw Idea

**Source:** Roadmap Item 15

**Description:** Build API query and UI to display searchable/filterable list of all employees with navigation to individual profile management pages.

## Initial Context

This is for the Ravn Skills Platform. The feature should allow admins to view, search, and filter all employee profiles, and navigate to individual profile management pages (like the seniority management page that already exists at /admin/profiles/:profileId/seniority).

## Key Requirements (Initial)

- API query to fetch all employee profiles
- UI to display the list of employees
- Search functionality
- Filter functionality
- Navigation to individual profile management pages
- Integration with existing admin profile routes (e.g., /admin/profiles/:profileId/seniority)
