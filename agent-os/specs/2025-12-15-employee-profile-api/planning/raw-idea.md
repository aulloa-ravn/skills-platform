# Raw Idea

## Feature Description

Employee Profile API — Build GraphQL queries to fetch profile data including validated skills (tiered), seniority timeline, and current assignments

## Source

Product Roadmap Item #5

## Size Estimate

M (Medium)

## Context

This feature is part of the Skills Platform project and represents the API foundation for displaying employee profile information. It follows the completion of:
- Database Schema & Migrations
- Skills Taxonomy Seeding
- Sample Data Seeding
- Authentication Foundation

This API will enable the Employee Profile UI (next roadmap item) to display comprehensive employee information including their validated skills organized in tiers, their seniority progression over time, and their current project assignments.
